/** A `Var` represents a time varying value. At all points in time a `Var`
  * contains a value of type `A`. Interested parties can subscribe to receive
  * updates when that value changes, and may react accordingly
  *
  * Note that `Vars` introduce state into a Gooey program, and this can break
  * substitution. (Describe more here.)
  *
  * Note that `Vars` are translated to a backend specific implementation. `Vars`
  * have no actual behavior themselves; they don't do anything. They only record
  * the behavior that should happen in the backend equivalent.
  *
  * Gooey makes no particular guarantees about how updates to `Vars` are
  * propagated. This is because `Vars` represent an abstraction over an backend
  * specific implementation, and different backends may have different
  * semantics.
