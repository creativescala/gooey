/** A Form is a utility to quickly collect information from the user. It trades
  * off flexibility for ease-of-use.
  *
  *   - `title` is the title of the form.
  *   - `component` is a `Component` that specifies the information to collect.
  *   - `submit` is the text on the button that submits the form.
  *   - `onSubmit` function is the action that takes place when the form is
  *     submitted.
  *
  * A Form is not a Component because it is designed to contain components, but
  * not be composed with other components.
